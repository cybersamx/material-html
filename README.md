# Material HTML

Material Design is awesome and Material-UI is a great Material Design-based UI library for the React framework. But what if I just want to use Material Design with just vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? There are several options:

* [MDB 5](https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/standard/) - 21.5k stars, last updated 6/2021
* [MUI CSS](https://www.muicss.com/) - 4.4k stars, last updated 6/2020
* [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) - 38.8k stars, last updated 6/2020
* [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/) - 31.9k stars, last updated 6/2017

Played with the aforementioned frameworks and found MDB 5 to be the most versatile and stable. MDB 5 stands for Material Design for Bootstrap 5. It has a version for plan vanilla HTML and CSS.

This project implements a few sample web pages using MDB 5.
